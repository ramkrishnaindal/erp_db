  "full_job_description": "About the job\nAbout Retool\n\nNearly every company in the world runs on custom software: Gartner estimates that up to 50% of all code is written for internal use. This is the operational software for refunding orders, underwriting loans, onboarding employees, analyzing transactions, and providing customer support. But most companies don’t have adequate resources to properly invest in these tools, leading to a lot of old and clunky internal software or, even worse, users still stuck in manual and spreadsheet flows.\n\nAt Retool, we’re on a mission to bring good software to everyone. We’re building a new type of development platform that combines the benefits of traditional software development with a drag-and-drop UI editor and AI, making it dramatically faster to build internal tools. We believe that the future of software development lies in abstracting away the tedious and repetitive tasks developers waste time on, while creating reusable components that act as a force multiplier for future developers and projects. The result is not just productivity, but good software by default. And that’s a mission worth striving for.\n\nToday, our customers span from small startups building their first operational tools to Fortune 500 companies building mission-critical apps for thousands of users across their business. Interested in joining us? Let us know!\n\nWHY WE'RE LOOKING FOR YOU\n\nRetool started as a way to address obstacles with internal tools and has grown into a company that solves internal tooling for thousands of companies (big and small).

You’ll initiate projects to generate strategic insights and help the company remain data-driven. You’ll build data pipelines, dashboards, and reports to streamline operations, inform strategic priorities, and empower stakeholders to make data-informed decisions. You’ll apply statistical knowledge and the scientific method to the data questions we face today, and help us think critically about the questions of tomorrow.\n\nWho You'll Work With\n\nAs a data scientist, you’ll work closely with engineering, design, and product teams to size opportunities, prioritize product features, set goals, and quantify impact. We’re a hard-working, passionate bunch who are motivated by collaboration, strong results, and bringing the impact of Retool to our customers.

You’ll need to be a self-starter and thrive in a dynamic environment\nComfortable with common git workflows and at least one scripting or statistical programming language (ideally Python and/or R)\n\nIn This Role, You'll\n\nEmbed with engineering, product, and design teams to surface key insights\nDevelop dashboards and define metrics that drive key product and business decisions \nBuild and maintain ETL pipelines\nWork with our engineering teams to validate existing data sources, identify opportunities to improve data quality, and craft requirements for robust new instrumentation as needed\nBe a self-starter\n\nFor candidates based in San Francisco, the pay range(s) for this role is listed below and represents base salary range for non-commissionable roles or on-target earnings (OTE) for commissionable roles. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Retool and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors such as (but not limited to), scope and responsibilities, the candidate’s experience and qualifications, and location.\n\nAdditional compensation in the form(s) of equity, and/or commission/bonuses are dependent on the position offered.

Nooks is loved by sales teams at companies like 1Password, Fivetran, Greenhouse, and hundreds more. For more information, visit Nooks.ai.\n\nThe role\n\nNote: Exact job title will be commensurate with experience\n\nWe have an ambitious product vision in a nascent area - AI-powered realtime collaboration - so there are a ton of interesting technical challenges on our roadmap.

These connections may be successful based on a wide variety of factors - where the sales rep is calling from, when they call, data quality, prior interactions. How do we extract insights from our data to make sales reps and teams using Nooks more productive by maximizing their connection rate?\nConversation funnels & markov models (data science/modeling)\nWhat does the anatomy of a call look like? If I say XYZ, what are the different ways the prospect might answer and the probabilities of each? Conditioned on the first half of the call, what does Nooks need to recommend to maximize the likelihood that a sales rep books a demo at the end of the call? \nLead scoring and account insights\nNooks surfaces leads that we think are a good fit to reach out to with first-touch emails and calls. We do this using AI \"deep research signals.\" Which signals are actually most likely to lead to good outcomes for the business (i.e converted revenue) and how do we use leading indicators and small amounts of data to prioritize the prospects that have the highest expected value of converting to revenue?\nRequirements\n\nBachelor's or Master's degree in Computer Science, Machine Learning, Data Science, or a related field.\nExpert in SQL and Python or R\n3+ years of industry experience\nRobust understanding of statistical and machine learning methods\nFull stack eng chops: reasonable proficiency in general purposes programming languages such as Python/Javascript, and with libraries like pandas, scikit-learn etc.\n\nNice to haves\n\nBackground in an analytical field like heuristics, data science &/or statistics\nPrior experiences working in both startup and research environments\nExperience with data transformation and data orchestration tools\n\nWe offer competitive compensation because we want to hire the best people and reward them for their contributions to our mission.

  "full_job_description": "About the job\nAbout Glean\n\nWe’re on a mission to make knowledge work faster and more humane. We believe that AI will fundamentally transform how people work. In the future, everyone will work in tandem with expert AI assistants who find knowledge, create and synthesize information, and execute work. These assistants will free people up to focus on the higher-level, creative aspects of their work.\n\nWe’re building a system of intelligence for every company in the world. On the surface, you can think of it as Google + ChatGPT for the enterprise. Under the hood, our platform is the connective tissue between AI and knowledge. It brings all of a company’s knowledge together, understands it at a deep level, provides industry-leading search relevance over it, and connects it to generative AI agents and applications.\n\nGlean was founded by a seasoned team of former Google search and Facebook engineers who saw a need in the enterprise space for their technical depth and passion for AI. We’re a diverse team of curious and creative people who want to help each other get big things done—so we can help other teams do the same.\n\nWe're backed by some of the Valley's leading venture capitalists—including Sequoia, Kleiner Perkins, Lightspeed, and General Catalyst—and have assembled a world-class team with senior leadership experience at Google, Slack, Facebook, Dropbox, LinkedIn, Stripe, Rubrik, Uber, Intercom, Pinterest, Palantir, and others.\n\nRole\n\nGlean is building a world-class Data Organization composed of data science, applied science, data engineering and business intelligence groups. This is a data science role based in our Palo Alto headquarters.\n\nAt Glean, data scientists collaborate with engineering, product management and design to\nDefine and build data assets, e.g. KPI definitions, data pipelines and dashboards, to measure the performance of AI-powered assistant products for knowledge workers.\nIdentify opportunities to improve these KPIs, and influence cross functional teams to incorporate associated changes into their roadmaps.\nCreate and maintain quantitative frameworks and methodologies, e.g. bring more rigor into experiment analyses, use statistical modeling to identify leading indicators of user growth and engagement.\n\nYou’d be embedded within a specific set of products in Glean’s large offering of search and generative AI products. These products aim to make Glean mission critical for the knowledge worker (i.e. the user) and the firm she works at (i.e. the customer).\n\nYou’d explore how Glean’s search and generative AI products should intersect. You’d explore different product modalities like web, mobile and desktop apps, as well as experiences where Glean’s embedded into other products like an internal portal or another B2B SaaS product like Slack. You’d explore how unstructured data in documents, structured data and data outside of an organization should come together. You’d look into the knowledge worker as a potential creator of generative AI experiences for others around her, rather than a mere consumer of these experiences. You’d explore knowledge workers in specific job function verticals like engineering and support. You’d think about empowering Glean’s customers to reign in the proliferated set of AI agents around them for maximum value, whether or not they are created by Glean.\n\nAt the intersection of all these domains is using product analytics to enhance a user and customer’s experience. Combined with enterprise-grade & highly performant AI, which’d be delivered by sister teams, such magical experience is the prerequisite for making Glean grow into over 1B knowledge workers out there.\n\nMinimum Qualifications\n\nYou have a Bachelors/Masters/PhD degree in Statistics, Mathematics or Computer Science, or another quantitative field.\nYou have 5+ years of industry experience as a data scientist. For PhD degree holders, the minimum years of required experience as a data scientist is 2 years.\nYou have strong business sense, and are strong at defining good product KPIs/guardrail metrics, dashboarding and analysis of raw data to derive strategic insights.\nYou are familiar with BI visualization tools such as Sigma, Metabase, Tableau or Looker.\nYou are proficient in SQL and the modern data stack (e.g. dbt pipelines for ETL/ELT).\nYou are proficient in Python.\nYou have experience in writing source-controlled code for pipelines and internal tools for data-oriented decision making.\nYou are strong at statistics. You have experience in applying these skills into tangible improvements in products, internal tools and processes using A/B testing and non-experimental methods.\nYou are concise and precise in written and verbal communication. Technical documentation is your strong suit. \n\nYou Are a Particularly Good Fit If\n\nYou have experience in B2B SaaS, especially in the enterprise AI space.\nYou have a very strong sense of ownership and self-motivation. You are laser focused on delivering business impact while growing as an individual along with Glean.\nYou are good at managing evolving priorities while bringing core initiatives to a success.\nYou have experience working with collaborators across large time zone differences.\n\nBenefits\n\nCompetitive compensation\nMedical, Vision and Dental coverage\nFlexible work environment and time-off policy\n401k\nCompany events\nA home office improvement stipend when you first join\nAnnual education stipend\nWellness stipend\nHealthy lunches and dinners provided daily\n\nFor California Based Applicants\n\nThe standard base salary range for this position is $175,000 - 250,000 annually.

Certain roles may be eligible for variable compensation, equity, and benefits.\n\nWe are a diverse bunch of people and we want to continue to attract and retain a diverse range of people into our organization.
